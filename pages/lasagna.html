        Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? 
        It's a great way to feed a crowd and 
        a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. 
        It freezes well. It reheats well. 
        Leftovers will keep you happy for days.

        Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover 
        sent me his favorite recipe for 
        lasagna which he has been cooking 
        since his college days. Alton's 
        original recipe created enough 
        lasagna for a small army so I halved 
        it. What is posted here will easily 
        serve eight people.

                skillet over medium low heat.
            </strong>
            Add the garlic and ginger; stir fry for 
            2 minutes or until soft and fragrant.

            <strong>Add the broth and the water.</strong>
            to the hot liquid and simmer for an 
            additional 5 minutes or until the noodles 
            have softened. Add the scallions and stir 
            to combine.

            <strong>Add the instant noodles</strong>
            A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, 
            more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. 
            Repeat until you have three layers and have 
            used up all the ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Remove from heat,</strong> 
            stir in the kale and carrots, and top with 
            crunchy panko crumbs (see notes) and a 
            soft-boiled egg (optional). Season with 
            chili oil, hot sauce, sesame oil, and/or 
            soy sauce and salt to taste.
